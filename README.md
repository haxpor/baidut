# baidut
Baidu translator for NodeJS and Browser with Promise ready.

# Installation

Install it via `npm install baidut`.

# Usage

You need to prepare Baidu environment first before making a call to translate.

```javascript
Baidut.builder
    .setAppId("2015063000000001")
    .setKey("12345678")
    .build();
```

Then translate it via

```javascript
Baidut.translate('苹果')
    .then((result) => {
    	console.log("translated text: " + result.trans_result[0].dst);
    }, (e) => {
    	console.log(e.code + ": " + e.message);
    });
```

# Note on Browser

As you likely to involve translating Unicode language as well thus defining that your HTML file has UTF-8 encoding is important to have conistency in displaying proper text for non-English language.

```html
<head>
...
<meta charset="UTF-8">
...
</head>
```
